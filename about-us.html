        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Electric Ink was founded in <strong>Uberaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil</strong>, where the global Electric Ink brand brings together management, administration, sales, and communication activities. From their headquarters, they lead the creation, research, and development of tattoo machines, inks, needles, and electronic equipment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Electric Ink Ireland</strong> operates as an online retailer, bringing the best of Electric Ink's globally-proven products to tattoo artists throughout Ireland. With over two decades of the parent company's industry experience and innovation, we provide Irish artists with premium tattoo supplies, exceptional customer service, and fast delivery across the country.</p>

        <h2>Excellence in Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>At Electric Ink, we design and manufacture every component in-house, ensuring precision, durability, and top-notch quality in all our products—from tattoo machines to inks and cosmetics for tattooing and micro-pigmentation. Certified by health organizations globally, including <strong>ANVISA</strong> in Brazil, we ensure all our products meet the highest safety standards.</p>
        
        <p>For over 23 years, artists have trusted us. Today, we export to more than 30 countries. From the humble beginnings of a tattoo artist, a turner, and a few assistants creating the perfect machine, to our current team of almost 450 professionals, innovation, safety, and perfection have always been at the heart of what we do.</p>
        
        <p>At Electric Ink, we are more than just equipment—we empower artists. Our products are designed to work in harmony, making the tattooing and micro-pigmentation process not only safer but also easier and more efficient for the professional and their clients.</p>
